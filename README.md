# synthetic-cannabinoids

ABOUT

Background:
Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are a subclass of new psychoactive substances (NPS) and are continuously emerging on global drug markets. These compounds may elicit dangerous acute side effects compared to THC, are often sprayed on top of herbs (e.g. cannabis), and then intentionally or unintentionally smoked by consumers. A visual identification of adulterated cannabis herbs is hardly possible. Therefore SCs represent a huge public health issue. Due to fast changes of the circulating substances the analytical detection is difficult. Therefore new screening methods are required.

Project aim and scope:
In this project, a random forest machine learning (ML) model was developed to generically screen for SCs based on metabolomics data. The metabolomics dataset was created by measuring urine samples positive or negative for SCs.

Repository content:
-SCs_ML_final.R (contains the whole workflow from data preprocessing, over the training of a random forest model, to visual analyses)
-data_preprocessing.R (contains the reformating of csv files exported from Progenesis QI to a matrix with features in columns and samples in rows)

How to get started?
Interesed visitors of this repository may reuse the code with their own metabolomics data to set up a random forest ML model. The question at hand may also deviate from a screening for SCs.
